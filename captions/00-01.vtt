Hi and welcome to this concise, highly productive course on the Julia programming language.

2
00:05.910 --> 00:06.800
I'm Dr. Nauman

3
00:06.810 --> 00:09.870
I have a PhD and a postdoc in applications of machine learning.

4
00:10.170 --> 00:15.420
I have more than 15 years of teaching experience and several best seller courses online, including many

5
00:15.420 --> 00:17.170
related to machine learning and data science.

6
00:17.790 --> 00:22.050
I know where people struggle with these courses since I've guided several thousand students in these

7
00:22.050 --> 00:22.470
areas.

8
00:23.070 --> 00:27.780
Data science and machine learning are fast paced fields where you need to keep up with the latest trends.

9
00:28.140 --> 00:33.510
If you get stuck with old tools, languages or frameworks currently in use in your job, you will have

10
00:33.510 --> 00:36.630
trouble when you try to switch jobs or try to solve new problems.

11
00:37.320 --> 00:41.490
This is why you need to keep yourself updated with the latest tools and languages coming out in this

12
00:41.490 --> 00:43.500
field in data science and machine learning.

13
00:43.500 --> 00:47.220
The hot new language that shows a lot of promise is the Julia programming language.

14
00:48.000 --> 00:50.750
Julia has been gaining acceptance in the industry very fast.

15
00:51.180 --> 00:53.820
Many people feel that it has the best of both worlds.

16
00:54.060 --> 00:55.650
It's very, very fast.

17
00:55.800 --> 01:00.780
It's comparable to fastest languages such as C, and it's also extremely easy to learn.

18
01:01.050 --> 01:05.280
And that's because it's basic syntax is very similar to the popular Python language.

19
01:05.610 --> 01:10.200
Due to these two trends, many feel that it will quickly become the language of choice, or at least

20
01:10.200 --> 01:13.740
a significant player in the fields of scientific computing, data science and machine learning.

21
01:13.980 --> 01:18.600
In this course, you will learn the best features of Julia in the smallest amount of time

22
01:18.600 --> 01:19.020
possible.

23
01:19.440 --> 01:23.040
We take a concise approach towards learning that will allow you to learn the basics.

24
01:23.040 --> 01:28.650
syntax of Julia, how it's different from Python, how to apply it to the concepts of data science,

25
01:28.650 --> 01:34.380
and last but not least, how it's machine learning capabilities can enable you to supercharge your career.

26
01:35.010 --> 01:38.850
If you know Julia, you will stand out from everyone else who has worked with data science on machine

27
01:38.850 --> 01:39.150
learning.

28
01:39.390 --> 01:43.890
Simply a mention of Julia in your profile will show potential employers that you are staying ahead of

29
01:43.890 --> 01:45.960
everyone else and know the state of the art.

30
01:46.560 --> 01:50.580
Knowing Julia would also allow you to work with the latest and greatest data science tools and machine

31
01:50.580 --> 01:53.970
learning models and also create your own very, very easily.

32
01:54.210 --> 01:57.390
And the best part is that there are no prerequisites for taking this course.

33
01:57.570 --> 02:01.800
If you know some basic python, it will definitely help, but you will still get all of the content

34
02:01.800 --> 02:03.660
if you've never worked with Python before.

35
02:04.110 --> 02:07.620
I will, however, assume that you've worked with some basic data science and machine learning models

36
02:07.620 --> 02:10.680
before, since we won't cover the machine learning during this course.

37
02:11.250 --> 02:15.900
But if you have worked with any data science tools and or machine learning models before, you should

38
02:15.900 --> 02:17.360
have no trouble following the content.

39
02:17.820 --> 02:19.830
This is aimed to be a first course in Julia

40
02:20.100 --> 02:24.300
It will give you the foundations you need to keep learning on your own even after the course.

41
02:24.630 --> 02:28.170
Take a look at the preview videos to see what kind of lectures to expect.

42
02:28.500 --> 02:33.090
Everything is practical, no boring slides, very concise and will get you up to speed in no time at

43
02:33.090 --> 02:33.300
all.

44
02:33.420 --> 02:34.830
And I provide stunning support.

45
02:35.070 --> 02:37.560
All questions are answered within 24 hours.

46
02:37.920 --> 02:40.620
All this coupled with a 30 day no questions asked...

47
02:40.950 --> 02:43.710
Money back guarantee means you have nothing to lose.

48
02:44.040 --> 02:46.380
So enroll now and I'll see you on the inside.
