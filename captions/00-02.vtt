00:01.330 --> 00:06.550
We installed Julia in the previous video, and irrespective of whether you're on Windows, Linux or

00:06.550 --> 00:08.310
Mac, you will arrive at this prompt.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.840
This is the Julia orrible prompt.

00:10.990 --> 00:14.050
You can go ahead and say any come on over here.

00:14.200 --> 00:20.470
So X is equal to five and you can say X. You can say Brandell an X and you can work with Julia over

00:20.470 --> 00:20.710
here.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.610
But this isn't very effective.

00:22.810 --> 00:27.640
What we want to do is arrive at a notebook like environment, which you might be familiar with if you

00:27.640 --> 00:28.360
work with Python.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.600
And we want to set that up so that we can experiment with our code and learn more effectively in setting

00:34.600 --> 00:35.220
that up.

00:35.230 --> 00:38.330
We are also going to take a look at how packages are installed in Julia.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.980
So for that, we have a built in package for installing packages.

00:41.980 --> 00:46.030
We have a building package which we can import using the using commands.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.710
So you can say using p.g.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.810
So Picardy is the package that is used to install other packages in Julia.

00:52.120 --> 00:57.700
You can say Pigot add and then give it the name of the package that you want to install.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.140
So this is going to be Iulia.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.860
Iulia is the package that allows us to interact with the Jupiter Nordberg.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.200
The Jupiter notebook itself is not part of Julia.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.340
It's going to come from Python.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.810
But we'll see how to install that in just a minute.

01:09.190 --> 01:15.460
So if you say Pigot ad and in double words we say Iulia, this is going to go ahead and set up a package

01:15.460 --> 01:15.880
for you.

01:16.330 --> 01:20.920
This might take a little bit of time because it has to install and set up some of the stuff.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.990
So we'll skip ahead in time until this is done.

01:23.260 --> 01:24.120
OK, so this is done.

01:24.130 --> 01:28.510
Your output might be slightly different because I've installed Iulia before, but unless you get an

01:28.510 --> 01:30.120
error, I Julia should be installed.

01:30.400 --> 01:36.670
Now, there are other ways of adding packages so you can go into the package mode by hitting the closing

01:36.670 --> 01:37.530
square bracket.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.240
You won't see it when I enter it, but the prompt is going to change.

01:41.290 --> 01:46.540
So I'm going to hit the closing square record and you will see that the branch change is too big.

01:46.870 --> 01:53.350
Now you can simply go ahead and say ADD and Iulia or whatever else package you want to install.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.580
So if you had that, it's already installed.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.720
So you're done from the package prompt.

01:58.840 --> 02:04.340
When you have a new prompt, you can simply hit backspace and this will drop you back to the Julia prompt.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.150
OK, so that is how you install packages in Julia straightforward.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.990
You don't have to handle the command line issues as you do with PIP.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.880
OK, so to recap, this is all we've done using begi because you don't install Iulia.

02:16.210 --> 02:21.540
Once Iulia is installed, we can start using this package using the using command.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.570
So using Iulia is going to allow you to import Iulia and start using its functions will cover this in

02:28.570 --> 02:30.460
depth when we start working with Julia.

02:30.460 --> 02:33.630
But for now, we're doing this just to set up our Jupiter lab environment.

02:33.640 --> 02:38.130
So you say using Iulia and then you say Jupiter lab function call.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.600
So when you do this function call, you will get a prompt that will ask you whether you want to set

02:43.600 --> 02:45.910
up a new environment, a new python environment.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.110
For Julia.

02:47.560 --> 02:53.020
The way this works is Python is going to provide the Jupiter notebook environment for you and everything

02:53.020 --> 02:54.340
else is going to be in Julia.

02:54.580 --> 02:58.880
But the environment, the idea that you work with is going to come from Python.

02:59.140 --> 03:04.510
Julia does have its own environment, but it's slightly glitchy right now because people are working

03:04.510 --> 03:04.870
on that.

03:04.870 --> 03:09.460
So we're going to stick with the Jupiter Nordberg environment that you might be more familiar with.

03:09.850 --> 03:13.150
So all you have to do is say Jupiter Lab, and it's going to give you a prompt.

03:13.330 --> 03:16.390
I'm not going to get that because I've already set up Jupiter Lab.

03:17.260 --> 03:21.550
But the prompt is going to ask you if a new environment should be set up for Julia, make sure that

03:21.550 --> 03:21.820
you hit.

03:21.820 --> 03:22.090
Why?

03:22.090 --> 03:23.790
So that you don't run into any conflicts.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.180
So when you hit, enter.

03:26.440 --> 03:31.870
You get a prompt, you say why, and then it's going to go ahead, download Minniecon to set up a basic

03:31.870 --> 03:35.850
Python environment for you and then show you the Jupiter lab environment.

03:35.950 --> 03:42.490
You can go ahead and download the resources for this, and it will give you a notebooks folder that

03:42.490 --> 03:45.930
is going to have all the Python notebooks that we are going to work with.

03:46.180 --> 03:51.130
So you can go ahead and check to make sure that your package is correctly installed.

03:51.130 --> 03:55.780
So you can go to 009 sanity check, start typing you to double the hey.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.180
So that's going to be a string.

03:57.310 --> 04:01.120
And if you say yes, get it or had three, it should give you.

04:01.180 --> 04:01.850
Hey, hey, hey.

04:02.290 --> 04:06.830
So this carrot is going to ensure that you are working with Julia and not with Python, obviously.

04:07.350 --> 04:11.980
OK, and then you can say virgin info and you will see what the current version is.

04:11.980 --> 04:18.250
I'm working with one five three, but one six zero has just come out and you should be able to work

04:18.250 --> 04:18.850
with that as well.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.640
There aren't any major changes from one five three to one six.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.810
But since Julia is evolving really quickly, there might be two other changes down the line, but we'll

04:25.810 --> 04:27.700
cover them as we progress.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.600
So once you're here, you can see all the notebooks over here.

04:30.610 --> 04:35.050
And as we progress with the course, you can go ahead and look at the individual files that we're working

04:35.050 --> 04:35.290
with.

04:35.530 --> 04:39.640
You can go along or look at the notebooks that I've provided.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.250
I would highly recommend that you take the code yourself so that you can get a thorough understanding

04:44.250 --> 04:45.880
of this if you want to follow along.

04:45.900 --> 04:51.060
You can click on Plus and create a Julia one five three or Julia one six zero notebook and.

04:52.050 --> 04:56.820
So let's move to the actual core of the course now and start working with the Julia language.
